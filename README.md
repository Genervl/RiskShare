# ðŸš€ PredictFi â€“ BlockDAG Hackathon Project

PredictFi is a decentralized prediction and trading platform built on the BlockDAG EVM.  
It provides two complementary modules:

1. Simple Trade Options â€“ short-term UP/DOWN price predictions (15s, 1m, 1h).  
2. Halal Prediction Pool â€“ Sharia-compliant YES/NO risk-sharing markets with refunds and pooled gains.
